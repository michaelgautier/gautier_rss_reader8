# Gautier RSS Reader v8

Streamlined access to information in RSS format in a desktop environment.

# Who
I am Michael Gautier and Iâ€™ve started this project to upgrade the RSS reader I last published in another repository on April 8, 2020. I maintain this project as an effort to attain the right balance between elements that can go into a software project. Of course, this is a balance as I perceive it.

# What
This project produces an RSS reader program that helps the user more efficiently access information delivered over the Web as news feeds in the RSS format. The goal is to work with the information that interests you in a way that lets you control how much time you spend immersed in media.

# Primary Goal
Version 7 works fine but I am building a new version to achieve other objectives. I do not intend to introduce major features different from version 7. I am contemplating removing features towards simplification but I am also looking at adding some unseen complexities to make the end result more convenient in terms of the timing of when information is available in the software.

The major goal is to adopt Autotools. The reason Autotools is desired is I perceive that it will streamline the way the software is packaged up for delivery across operating systems. A proper build system can contribute to software project longevity which is a major criteria of this project.

# Why GPL
I chose the GPL license because I have zero intent to sell the software and I believe that advantage in technology is not based on hidden code. Software development is an art and science that all should have access. The act of software development itself can be a service that is well funded. However, if a project stakeholder intends, the code itself can be free for future generations to grow.

# Planning
Ten days ago, I derived new ideas that are now part of a quasi-formal software plan. Over the coming weeks and months, I will seek to bring those ideas into existence in the form of software.
